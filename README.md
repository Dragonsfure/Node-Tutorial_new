# Node.js Tutorial with Typescript

Node.js Tutorial done after the Tutorial from [Net Ninja Node.js Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9jsz4LDYc6kv3ymONOKxwBU), but done with Typescript.

## As regards, if this is useful ?

I wanted to accomplish to get familiar with Typescript more, since it can be still important for future Projects :D
Even if i don't use many of the advantages for typescript right now.

It is only done to get more familiar with these different Techniques.
